                                    <li><strong>Service Charges:</strong> The placement service charge is due immediately upon the helper initiating work for the client.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Direct Hires:</strong> Clients cannot independently hire candidates shared through our platform without completing the service fee. Failing to pay the placement fee while employing candidates shared by us will result in legal actions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Helper Dignity:</strong> We request clients to judge helpers by their work and treat them with value, without discrimination based on appearance, age, or religion.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Direct Payments:</strong> Salary must be paid directly by the client to the helper. If a helper leaves, the client is responsible for paying them for the exact number of days worked.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Salary Advances:</strong> Giving salary advances is at the client\'s own discretion. Maid It Easy is not responsible for retrieving or adjusting advance salaries if a helper leaves.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Registration Fees:</strong> The registration fee (Rs. 1500/2000/3000) is non-refundable if the customer decides not to participate in interviews after registration.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Fee Return Exception:</strong> Registration fees will only be refunded if Maid It Easy fails to share any helper profiles within 25 working days. Once a profile is shared, no refund requests apply.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Salary Adjustments:</strong> Helper market salaries change over time. If a client refuses to adjust their salary budget to reflect current market rates, replacement matching becomes difficult, and no refunds are granted.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Worker Safety Disclaimers:</strong> Helpers must not be subjected to physical, emotional, or verbal abuse. If a helper leaves due to mistreatment or changes in job roles without prior written approval, no replacements or refunds will be processed.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Suitable Backups:</strong> We agree to replace candidates with suitable profiles willing to execute the same duties within 15 to 25 working days, depending on candidate availability.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Credit Notes:</strong> If we fail to find a replacement candidate within 25 working days, we will issue a credit note for the full service fee, valid for future bookings.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Salary Clearances:</strong> Clients must clear all salary dues of the previous helper before a replacement candidate is deployed.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Illness or Leave:</strong> If a helper takes temporary leave due to illness or family emergencies, no replacements apply if the helper agrees to return upon recovery. If they fail to return within 7 days, a replacement can be requested.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Job Scope:</strong> Job descriptions must be outlined before helper placement. Pay cannot be cut, and helpers cannot be forced to perform tasks outside the agreed job scope.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Notice Period:</strong> Clients must give a 15-day notice if they are unhappy with the helper to allow us to search for replacements.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Hiring Conviction:</strong> Date of helper joining might vary due to transport, weather, or medical issues. Service charges apply after candidate finalization via calls and document previews.</li>
